canvas-adventures
=================

Messing around with HTML5 canvas and basic 3D rendering principles.

Currently supports perspective projection and rotation of arbitrary 3D rectangles. <a href=https://rawgithub.com/igillis/canvas-adventures/master/cube.html target="_blank">Example.</a>

TODO:
  - shim for requestAnimationFrame
  - Create rectangle obj
  - Create simpler constructors for faces/rectangles
  - Support visibility calculations (probably painter's algorithm for now)
  - Interactivity
  - Measure framerate
  - Support solid faces
